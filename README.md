# Coffee Shop Chain Database
## 1. Scenario
In this scenario, a coffee shop chain is looking to expand nationally by opening several franchise locations. They want to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure as part of their expansion process.\
Our job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and make it easier for their executives to make data-driven decisions.\
Currently, their data resides in several systems: accounting software, supplier databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and even spreadsheets.\
We need to design a **central database** to house all of the data. We will then **create the database objects** and **load them with source data**. Finally, you will create subsets of data your business partners require, export them, and load them into staging databases using several RDBMS.\
